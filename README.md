# Phonological Edit Distance
This uses the mighty power of [Phonological Corpus Tools](http://phonologicalcorpustools.github.io/CorpusTools/) to calculate the average phonological edit distance of all items in a set. This can be used as a proxy measure of phonological dissimilarity.

NOTE: there is more to come here, I'm just in the middle of writing a paper and am efficiently procrastinating by putting parts of this cool program up here.



###dependencies:
To run this you must have:
    - [Python 3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/)  
    - [Phonological Corpus Tools](http://phonologicalcorpustools.github.io/CorpusTools/)  
    - [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
